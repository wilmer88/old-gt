## Career Connection

The concepts you learn about with regards to object-oriented programming and test-driven development are vital to your future programming career, and you’ll encounter them frequently during the interviewing process. Let's examine the roles they might play in your job search:

### Object-Oriented Programming

Object-oriented programming principles are language-agnostic: for the most part, no matter which language you’re programming in, the principles are the same.

We've introduced you to Node.js, and now you learn how to use the JavaScript language to implement object-oriented coding standards. However, the principles you learn don’t just apply to JavaScript&mdash;in fact, they’re often more important in other languages.

You see, JavaScript is a functional programming language. In other words, you can write JavaScript without classes and inheritance (and other OOP functionalities). But in languages like C# and Java (and many others), you can only write code within an object-oriented paradigm.

But why bother with OOP if you're learning JavaScript and you want a full-stack JavaScript job? Well, even if you want a career in full-stack JavaScript programming, other languages might be in higher market demand. So when it's time to hit the streets to interview, and the position you're interviewing for is an object-oriented programming language position, you might consider jumping back into this module to refresh your memory!

### Test-Driven Development

Ah! Test-driven development is an age-old debate among programmers. Some argue that no one has time to write tests as well as code, especially under a tight deadline. On the other hand, when your code fails to work and you don’t know why, you can lose valuable time trying to investigate. For that reason, some programmers suggest that you can’t afford to not write tests!

Love it or hate it, you’ll likely have to address your experience with test-driven development in job interviews. Don’t pretend you love it if you find it tedious. Instead, be honest about your level of experience. You can explain that you’ve implemented it in a few projects, that you appreciate the safety net it provides, and that you’re eager to learn about implementing it in an enterprise application. 

### Looking to the Future

Being able to write JavaScript in an object-oriented manner and test this code effectively is an important skill set to demonstrate to prospective employers. You should have at least one example repository on your GitHub that implements both of these approaches.

If you enjoyed writing tests this week, consider working in quality assurance, or QA. Make no mistake&mdash;QA developers aren’t just test writers. They’re responsible for a number of components in the software development cycle, including the following:

- Validation&mdash;writing master plans for the entire application and approving test criteria for validating a product and its process

- Documentation&mdash;writing and controlling documentation of software development and implementing change and QA procedures

- Quality&mdash;ensuring that all software and code is high-quality and follows applicable company standards

- Improvement&mdash;developing and implementing quality-improvement plans

If this sparks your interest, head over to Indeed.com and search for key terms like “QA developer,” “QA tester,” “quality assurance,” or “QA analyst.”

### Technical Interview Preparation

Many companies use algorithm questions during the technical interview. We strongly recommend that you practice these. Doing so will prepare you to handle some of the most common questions in an interview or promotion discussion.

Please refer to the class repository to find these algorithms:

- Coding Algorithm #1: Linear Search

- Coding Algorithm #2: Is Unique

- Coding Algorithm #3: Is Anagram

For practice in a live, interview-style IDE, complete the following algorithm challenge. The solution will be discussed in the weekly recommended session.

Once you start, you'll have seven days to complete it. After the seven days has elapsed, the challenge will close.
