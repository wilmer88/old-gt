Hello again! Time for another dose of career content, helping you to understand how what you learned this week relates to your future development career&mdash;and of course keeping you on track to reach that employer-ready status!

On that note, last week we mentioned the [Career Services Milestone: Develop Your Resume.](https://sites.google.com/2u.com/careerservices-webdev/coding-milestones/milestone-develop-your-resume) If you didn't complete that yet, we encourage you to get that resume over to a Profile Coach as soon as possible! This is an important step toward unlocking employer-ready status and accessing a wide range of materials.

### Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)

Sequelize is the ORM library of choice for many production applications, maybe because it can help them do all of the following:

- Save time and effort (and time equals money, in the business world).

- Harness the power of NodeJS or other languages.

- Keep their code robust.

- Manage queries.

- Maintain multiple databases.

No wonder Sequelize is insanely popular, in active use by thousands of repositories and starred by thousands of GitHub users!

### Looking to the Future

Preparing to interview means not just reviewing the material youâ€™ve learned during boot camp but also knowing how this material relates to other technologies, beyond what you'll learn here.

You don't have to know how to use these technologies, but you should at least have a cursory knowledge of what they are!

For Node.js, the popular go-to ORM library is Sequelize. Research the go-to ORM for the following three programming languages, and list the advantages and disadvantages for each one.

* Java

* C#

* Python

By no means is this an exhaustive list, so feel free to keep researching! The more you know, the better equipped you'll be.


### Prepare for the Technical Interview

Many companies use algorithm questions during the technical interview. We strongly recommend that you practice these. Doing so will prepare you to handle some of the most common questions in an interview or promotion discussion.

Please refer to the class repository to find the following algorithms:

- Coding Algorithm #1: Double Triple Map

- Coding Algorithm #2: Array Intersection

- Coding Algorithm #3: Squares of a Sorted Array

For practice in a live, interview-style IDE, complete the following algorithm challenge. The solution will be discussed in the weekly recommended session.

Once you start, you'll have seven days to complete it. After seven days, the challenge will close.

* CodeSignal Algorithm: [FizzBuzz Plus Plus](https://app.codesignal.com/public-test/7hMoNBiFhuHrPf8Lp/fy3rAkYRnKwKRe)
